A project completed during IntelÂ® Unnati Industrial Training Program 2024.

## Introduction
In today's data-centric world, organizations face the challenge of not only storing vast amounts of structured data but also extracting meaningful insights to drive decision-making. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an AI-based solution capable of effectively analyzing and interpreting structured data.

### Objectives
1. **Represent Knowledge:** Use advanced techniques to structure and highlight critical information and relationships within the data.
2. **Generate Insights:** Analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, offering valuable insights that are not easily recognized through manual analysis.
3. **Aid Decision-Making:** Present the generated insights in a user-friendly manner to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on accurate and comprehensive data analysis.

### Dataset Description
**Source:** [Kaggle Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varshitanalluri/crop-recommendation-dataset)
### Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured no missing values or duplicates.
- **EDA:** Visualized data distribution and relationships.
- **Preprocessing:** Label encoding and feature scaling.
- **Model Training:** Random Forest Classifier, evaluated with accuracy scores, and tuned with RandomizedSearchCV.

### Tools Used
- **Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn,
- **Platforms:** Google Colab, Next.js, Flask, Vercel

### Results
- High accuracy in crop prediction.
- Visualizations: Histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, bar plots, and confusion matrix.
- Insights on optimal crop conditions and critical features.
- Predict best crop according to user soil and weather conditions.
